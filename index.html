    <img src="https://www.artst.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Van-Gogh-Self-Portrait-1889.jpg.webp" alt="Van-Gogh-Self-Portrait-1889" style="width: 270px;"> 
    <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: larger;text-align: left;">Vincent van Gogh (1853–1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter, widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in Western art. He created over 2,000 artworks, including about 860 oil paintings, in just over a decade. Known for bold colors, expressive brushwork, and emotional intensity, his famous works include Starry Night, Sunflowers, and The Bedroom. Despite his talent, Van Gogh struggled with poverty and mental illness throughout his life. He sold very few paintings while alive and relied on support from his brother Theo. His troubled life ended tragically when he died at age 37. Today, he is celebrated worldwide as a genius whose art reshaped modern painting.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: #2f4156;">1. The Starry Night</h2>
        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: larger;text-align: left;">Van Gogh was admitted to the hospital at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole, near Saint-Remy-de-Provence, for bouts of sadness and insanity. During this time, he painted The Starry Night, a view from his asylum’s east-facing window(or at least his version of the view). It uses a unique swirling technique, which many art experts believe gives excitement and energy to the sky as it blends with the distant mountain.
In a number of ways, the artwork contrasts the natural with the man-made, producing a stunning aesthetic impact. The buildings and everything on the ground are painted with vertical brushstrokes to indicate that mankind is focused on the heavens, while the night sky is painted with swirling strokes to give a joyful and dynamic atmosphere.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: #2f4156;">2. The Potato Eaters</h2>
        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: larger;text-align: left;">The Potato Eaters is an oil painting that was completed in April 1885 in Nuenen, Netherlands. The painting’s original oil sketch is on display at the Kröller-Müller Museum in Otterlo, and he also created a number of lithographs of the picture. The Potato Eaters is the intentional effort of an enthusiastic young artist to establish himself to the world. He would create numerous preparatory drawings and lithographs in an effort to improve his technique before creating a mature figure work.</p>

        <h2 style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: #2f4156;">3. Wheatfield with Crows</h2>
        <p style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: larger;text-align: left;">Wheatfield with Crows is an extended canvas painting that displays a dramatic foggy sky packed with crows above a wheat field. Two-thirds of the canvas is taken up by a wind-swept wheat field. The spectator is drawn into the picture by an empty route. Van Gogh is reported to have painted Wheatfield with Crows in July 1890. Although it is not as commonly known to the general public, it is considered one of his best works. It is widely assumed that this was van Gogh’s last work. However, since no definite historical records exist, art historians are unsure whether which work was van Gogh’s final.</p>
